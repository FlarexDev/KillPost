This JavaScript script automates sending a specified number of POST requests to a given URL using Puppeteer and prompt-sync libraries. 
It launches a headless browser instance and a new incognito browser context and navigates to the target URL.
For each request, it creates an empty object to represent the POST parameters and sends the POST request using fetch function in the context of the page.
The script logs whether the request was successful or failed based on the HTTP response status code.
And it closes the headless browser instance.
Note that the script does not specify any POST parameters, 
so you would need to modify it to set the POST parameters according to the requirements of the target URL.
Along with the "https" or "http" parameters, you will need to modify them directly on the code for them to work!
