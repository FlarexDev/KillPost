It uses your own local browser to do requests, and it's made to test your own site and simulate **high traffic**
Made for ethical purpose and not to do any harm since it has zero measurements to hide your IP.

# Setup

It's very easy to setup just like any javascript application!

If you're new to this you can get started by installing node.js locally, and using ```node -v``` to confirm that
you have installed node app. (Runtime JavaScript)

Once you have node.js setup, you can do ahead and cd to PosKills directory which should look like this : ```C:\users\FireEagle\OneDrive\Desktop\PosKill>```
And do ```node index.js``` <br> That should start the app and once the app is started you can go ahead and have some fun testing ***Your own site***!

<li>Side Notes : Majority of the websites are surely immune to this and it won't effect them at all, the real purpose of this is to simulate high traffic on your site 
but not it cannot be used to do any big damage. <br>
  
  <h3>System Warns</h3>
  
  <li> High Amounts of spams if used Illegally on public sites can lead to you being tracked by the owners. <br>
  <li> I don't take responsibility for any coincidences you may face using this. <br>
  <li> You'll be fine as long as you use the tool for what it's meant to be used. <br>
